Member Present: Ravi Gupta and John Lee
Major Issue for discussion: Having issues with adding and deleting customers and staff account because our database wouldn't update after adding or deleting the accounts.
Major Decision: Try to figure out how to actually code using a loop array to see if a customer or staff is being added or not. Testing whether it goes into the database or not.
