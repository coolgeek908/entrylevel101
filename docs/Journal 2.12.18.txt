Member Present: Ravi Gupta and John Lee
Major Issue for discussion: How to figure out to make Xampp work to connect our php files to run the page on the browser. Apache always say error and cannot start.
Major Decision: Try to search google on how to run Xampp (apache) because apache keeps saying error. We have found the solution to start Apache by changing the port number.
